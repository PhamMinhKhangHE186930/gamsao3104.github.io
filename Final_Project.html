                    At the end of December, the best-selling car race in the Vietnamese market in 2023 has just officially finished. Accordingly, the number 1 position in the 2023 list has changed mainly when Mitsubishi Xpander surpassed Toyota Vios to become the car model with the highest sales last year of 19,740 cars.

                    <article>
                        The Japanese MPV model attracts customers thanks to its youthful, modern, and practical design, meeting many needs for family and service businesses. Modern amenities and affordable prices compared to competitors, from only 555 - 698 million VND, are also factors that help Xpander maintain its appeal to Vietnamese customers throughout the year.

                            Behind the Mitsubishi Xpander is the king of the B-sized sedan segment in the Vietnamese market, Hyundai Accent with 17,452 vehicles delivered to customers in 2023. This small sedan is considered the "golden egg" of the Korean brand. Quoc Khi contributed to 25% of the company's total revenue last year.

                            Despite the rise of competitors in the C-size SUV segment, Mazda CX-5 still maintains its foothold in the Vietnamese car market. The car's 2023 revenue will reach 16,808 units, growing about 33% over the same period last year.

                            Selling only about 720 fewer cars than the Mazda CX-5, the Ford Ranger remains firmly in the top 5 best-selling cars for the second year in a row (5th place in 2022) with 16,085 units. Notably, the American model continues to be the only pickup truck in the Top 10 best-selling cars in Vietnam for 5 consecutive years (2019-2023).

                        <p>
                            The fact that the Toyota Vios 2023 in Vietnam is only a facelift while neighboring markets all receive a new generation has caused this car model to significantly lose its appeal in the past year. Specifically, Toyota Vios sold 13,521 cars in 2023, down more than 10,000 units compared to last year, thereby being usurped by Mitsubishi Xpander as the 'sales king' of Vietnamese cars.
